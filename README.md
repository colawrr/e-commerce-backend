  ## Description:
  For this project I was tasked with creating the backend for an ecommerce website. This app uses Express and Sequelize to interact with the MYSQL database. The walkthrough videos provide a walkthrough of the operation.
  ## Installation:
  Clone the repository from Github. This app uses Express, Node and Sequelize. To connect to the MYSQL database use `mysql -u root -p` and refer to the .env file for the password. Then source the schema.sql file. Run `npm run seed` and then `npm start` to connect the server.
  ## Usage:
  You will be allowed to view, add, edit and delete products, categories and tags.
