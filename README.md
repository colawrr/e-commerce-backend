  ## Description:
  For this project I was tasked with creating the backend for an ecommerce website. This app uses Express and Sequelize to interact with the MYSQL database. The walkthrough videos provide a walkthrough of the operation.
  ## Installation:
  Clone the repository from Github. This app uses Express, Node and Sequelize. To connect to the MYSQL database use `mysql -u root -p` and refer to the .env file for the password. Then source the schema.sql file. Run `npm seed` and then `npm start` to connect the server.
